# CucurbitViT_Model
# Abstract:
Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is critical for minimizing agricultural losses and improving crop production. Watermelon is a popular fruit worldwide for its taste and texture. This research presents CucurbitViT, a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model for classifying watermelon diseases, including Anthracnose, Downy Mildew, and Mosaic Virus, alongside healthy samples. Using a curated dataset of 1,155 high-resolution images, data preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion, gamma correction, and data augmentation were employed to enhance image quality and balance class distributions. The dataset was split into training (80\%), validation (10\%), and testing (10\%) sets, ensuring robust evaluation. The CucurbitViT model achieved a 99\% classification accuracy on the test set, significantly outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Precision, recall, and F1-scores were consistently high across all categories, demonstrating the model's reliability in disease classification. The potential of Vision Transformers for plant disease detection paves the way for practical applications in agriculture. The proposed model can be integrated into mobile or web platforms, enabling real-time disease diagnosis and supporting farmers in mitigating crop losses. Future research will focus on extending the model's application to other cucurbit crops and diseases, enhancing its utility in diverse agricultural scenarios.
